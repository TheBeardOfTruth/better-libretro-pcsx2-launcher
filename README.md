# libretro-pcsx2-launcher

A fork of [PCSX2 Launcher](https://github.com/eduardomozart/libretro-pcsx2-launcher) (which itself is a fork of [Dolphin Launcher](https://github.com/robloach/libretro-dolphin-launcher)) that contains some modifications to enhance functionality on *nix (linux, really).

Current changes:

- Unbroke the old one (cmdl were wrong so it wouldn't even launch PCSX2 even with nonstandard path accounted for)
- Can now launch PCSX2 UI from retroarch without *having* to load a game.
- Rudimentary support for changing preferences at build time (e.g and currently only support for building with -bigpicture, export `PCSX2L_NO_BIG_PICTURE` if you don't want big picture)
- Respects more canonical binary strings
- Easier to extend/maintain
- Doesn't use special cases for launching flatpak simplifying the logic.
- Corrected source code comments to correctly refer to PCSX2 and added some additional info in some cases
- Corrected file names to refer to PCSX2

Future changes:
- see todo.md
