# libretro-pcsx2-launcher

A fork of [PCSX2 Launcher](https://github.com/eduardomozart/libretro-pcsx2-launcher) (which itself is a fork of [Dolphin Launcher](https://github.com/robloach/libretro-dolphin-launcher)) that contains some modifications to enhance functionality on *nix (linux, really).

Current changes:

- respects more canonical binary strings
- easier to extend
- doesn't use special cases for launching flatpak simplifying the logic.
- corrected source code comments to correctly refer to PCSX2 and added some additional info in some cases
- corrected file names to refer to PCSX2

Future changes:
- see todo.md
