## To do:

### Build
- add convenient interface for changing canonical program string at compile time (environment variable probably)
- add more canonical strings if found (e.g flatpak pcsx2-qt)

### Runtime
- potentially add ability to load custom command from disk (i.e if pcsx2 is installed to some unusual name like pcsx2-canary)
